## LRR-CED: Low Resolution Reconstruction aware Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Network for Direct Sparse-View CT Image Reconstruction 

This work provides a framework for sparse-view CT image reconstruction using fully convolutional encoder-decoder networks. We provide two variations of the approach namely LRR-CED (D) with fully convolutional dense networks and LRR-CED(U) with UNet.
